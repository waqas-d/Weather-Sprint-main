Peer review desc: Starting out his html look's similar to the figma. just some center alignment as well as the list of favorites has to genorate a bullete point list with the saved favorites. The background is too pixelated. and the columns are too small and not at the right hight or width. Also the favorites does save on the local storage However it doesn't display on the favorites list. Also The time Doesn't work. But other than that the high and the low works. as well as the time and clear sky's.
